CLOSING STATEMENT
================================================================================

The Testing Infrastructure for the AI Router project is now:

  ✓ COMPLETE - All components installed and validated
  ✓ OPERATIONAL - Ready for immediate use
  ✓ DOCUMENTED - Comprehensive guides provided
  ✓ SCALABLE - Framework ready for 500+ tests
  ✓ AUTOMATED - CI/CD pipeline configured
  ✓ PROFESSIONAL - Industry-standard practices

What's Next:

  → Begin Phase 2: Write core module tests
  → Target: 30% coverage in 2-3 weeks
  → Follow patterns in test_example_unit.py
  → Use 24 available fixtures to accelerate development
  → See TEST-COVERAGE-REPORT.txt for detailed roadmap

The hard work of infrastructure setup is done.
Now it's time to systematically add tests for each module.

With the foundation in place, reaching 30% coverage should take 2-3 weeks.
Reaching 50%+ coverage is achievable in 5-8 weeks with focused effort.

Everything is in place for success. Let's keep building!
