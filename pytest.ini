    performance: Performance tests (slow, benchmarks)
    smoke: Smoke tests (very fast, basic checks)
    windows: Windows-specific tests
    wsl: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) specific tests
    macos: macOS-specific tests
    linux: Linux-specific tests (non-WSL)
    gpu: GPU-dependent tests
    slow: Tests that take longer to run
    flaky: Known flaky tests that may fail intermittently
    skip_ci: Tests to skip in CI environment
    machine_specific: Tests that behave differently per machine
